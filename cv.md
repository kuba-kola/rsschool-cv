**About me**
============
For 7 years I successfully worked as a leading constructor in the engineering ofunderground structures. When engineering became less attractive to me and thecompany became too pro-governmental, I decided to try myself at somethingnew. I found and completed the JavaScript courses, at the same time growingmy Twitter account, and the Twitter account of FC Krumkachy. At the moment JSis my main driving force and motivation. I am actively investing my free time inself-development and education and continue to master HTML, CSS, JavaScript,ReactJS and not going to stop there! My strengths are - my sense of humor, Imake friends easily and could find a common language with any person, I'm notafraid of new challenges and constructive criticism, I'm ready to do a lot toachieve personal and family goals, not forgetting about work life balance.
